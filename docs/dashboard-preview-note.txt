You can replace this with an actual screenshot of your running dashboard. 

To capture a screenshot of your dashboard:
1. Start the application
2. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser
3. Take a screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4 on Mac, Win+Shift+S on Windows)
4. Save the image as "dashboard-preview.png" in this directory

This will make your README look more professional and give users a preview of what to expect.
